# googleDocsAddTwoLinesOnOpen
op open, add two lines to document and move cursor to beginning of document

PROMPTS
write a program, that uses the google docs API, that:

upon every opening of a specified document, two empty lines are added to the beginning of the document, then the cursor is moved to the beginning of the document, in input mode, ready for text input
...
how do i integrate this code into the GCP?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to replace the YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID placeholder with the ID of the Google Doc you want to modify. The ID can be found in the URL of the document:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/your_document_id_here/edit

Please note that this program is intended to run locally. To have the changes made upon every opening of the specified document, you might consider using Google Apps Script to create an onOpen trigger function. However, Google Apps Script currently does not support setting the cursor position.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To integrate the given Python code into Google Cloud Platform (GCP), you can use Google Cloud Functions. Cloud Functions allows you to run code in response to events, such as HTTP requests, Cloud Storage events, or Firestore events. For this example, we'll create an HTTP-triggered Cloud Function that you can call whenever the specified Google Doc is opened.

Here's how to deploy the Python code as a Cloud Function:

1. Install the Google Cloud SDK (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2. Authenticate with your Google Cloud Platform account:

gcloud auth login

3. Set your GCP project:

gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

*Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of your GCP project.
4. Create a folder for your Cloud Function and move to that folder:

  mkdir my-cloud-function
  cd my-cloud-function
  
5. Inside the my-cloud-function folder, create a main.py file and paste the provided Python code into it. Modify the main() function as follows:

  def update_document(request):
    # ...
    # (the rest of the code remains the same)
    
This change makes the function an HTTP-triggered function.
6. Create a requirements.txt file inside the my-cloud-function folder with the following content:

  google-auth==2.6.0
  google-auth-httplib2==0.1.1
  google-auth-oauthlib==0.6.0
  google-api-python-client==2.26.1
7. Deploy the cloud function:

  gcloud functions deploy update_document \
    --runtime python310 \
    --trigger-http \
    --allow-unauthenticated

8. After the deployment finishes, you'll see a message containing the URL of your deployed Cloud Function. You can call this URL whenever the specified Google Doc is opened.

Unfortunately, there's no way to directly trigger this Cloud Function upon opening a Google Doc. As a workaround, you can use Google Apps Script to make an HTTP request to the deployed Cloud Function every time the document is opened:

In your Google Doc, go to Extensions > Apps Script.

Create a new script file (.gs) or open the existing Code.gs.

Add the following code:

function onOpen() {
  var url = 'YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL';
  UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
}

Replace YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL with the URL of your deployed Cloud Function.
9. Save the script (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S), then go to Extensions > Apps Script > Triggers. Add a new trigger with the following configuration:

-Choose which function to run: onOpen
-Choose which deployment should run: Head
-Event source: From a document
-Event type: On open
-Save the trigger. Now the Cloud Function will be called whenever the Google Doc is opened.

Keep in mind that this setup might not instantly update the cursor position as you originally intended, since the Google Apps Script triggers an HTTP request to the Cloud Function, and the API call response time may vary.
